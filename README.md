# Preprint-Paper-on-Indefinite-Summations
This repository contains my research on a novel approach to indefinite summation using integral transform methods. The paper introduces a generalized framework leveraging Laplace transforms and continuous binomial transforms to evaluate nontrivial sums systematically. We also present techniques for handling varying step sizes and nonlinear variable transformations in discrete summation.
