# Preprint-Paper-on-Indefinite-Summations
This repository contains my research on a novel approach to indefinite summation using integral transform methods. The paper introduces a generalized framework leveraging Laplace transforms and continuous binomial transforms to evaluate nontrivial sums systematically. We also present techniques for handling varying step sizes and nonlinear variable transformations in discrete summation.   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28612283
